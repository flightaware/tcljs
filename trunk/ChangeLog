    * Makefile.in, configure.in: spidermonkey's install is well-behaved now,
    so we can discard some of our little hacks.  We no longer look into
    spidermonkey's source tree for includes, they're in /usr/local/include.  
    We no longer need to know the spidermonkey build type.  We can link 
    libTclJs.so with shared library libjs.so or whatever (TEA standard) 
    rather than having to use static library libjs.a.

    Update dtp.kit doc processor invocation to use dtplite with expected
    dtplite arguments for directing output.

    * generic/tcljs.c: when creating a new javascript interpreter, set the
    global class flags to JSCLASS_GLOBAL_FLAGS rather than 0, in accordance
    with the docs.

    * tclconfig/tcl.m4, tclconfig/ChangeLog, tclconfig/install.sh: Upgrade
    to TEA version 3.9.

    * doc/tcljs.man: Update docs to reflect that the number of arguments
    is no longer required when defining a JavaScript function that calls
    out to a Tcl proc.  Clean up docs a bit.  Update copyrights.

    * Makefile.in, configure.in: spidermonkey's install is well-behaved now,
    so we can discard some of our little hacks.  We no longer look into
    spidermonkey's source tree for includes, they're in /usr/local/include.  
    We no longer need to know the spidermonkey build type.  We can link 
    libTclJs.so with shared library libjs.so or whatever (TEA standard) 
    rather than having to use static library libjs.a.

    * generic/tcljs.c: when creating a new javascript interpreter, set the
    global class flags to JSCLASS_GLOBAL_FLAGS rather than 0, in accordance
    with the docs.

    * tclconfig/tcl.m4, tclconfig/ChangeLog, tclconfig/install.sh: Upgrade
    to TEA version 3.9.
